[![](gcc-lua.png "Lua plugin for GCC")][Lua plugin for GCC]
The [Lua plugin for GCC] extends the [GNU Compiler Collection] with the ability
to run Lua scripts. The plugin provides an interface to register callback
functions for plugin events, and inspect the abstract syntax tree of a
translation unit. The plugin is useful for static C code analysis. The Lua
plugin for GCC supports GCC 4.5 to 4.9 and [Lua] 5.1 or 5.2 or [LuaJIT].
